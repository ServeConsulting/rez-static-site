To get started:

1. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install

    # Using Yarn
    yarn
    ```

2. Rename /docs to /public (This is for github pages)

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm run serve

    # Using Yarn
    yarn run serve
    ```

    Now you should be able to see the project running at localhost:8080.
